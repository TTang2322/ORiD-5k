# pytorch-resnet-Adam-ODIR-5K
This is the PyTorch implementation of RESNET network trained on ODiR dataset 

### Requirements. 
[PyTorch] (https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch)

[torchvision] (https://github.com/pytorch/vision)

### Update.
Adding support for CPU. Add ```--cpu``` can make the training or evaluation in cpu mode.

### Train with script! (16-bit precision) 
./run.sh 

Using the run.sh script to generate the training log and models of different versions of RESNET in 16-bit or 32-bit precision.
